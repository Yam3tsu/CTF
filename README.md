This is a collection of CTF solves/writeups. If the source code of the solve is not in the folder it means that the it wasn't attached to the challenge so I had to reverse it. Sometimes I kept the IDA compressed database, so it's possibile to see the structs which I defined and how I renamed the variables.

When I created this repository, I had already solved several challenges, but I hadn’t written their writeups at the time. I decided to upload some of them anyway and write the corresponding writeups later. That said, the solution for each challenge is available in the `exploit.py` file while the writeup is in the `README.md`.

I apologize if the exploits for the older challenges may be hard to read — this is due to the rush of solving them during the competition. Whenever I write a challenge writeup, I also take the time to make the exploit more readable, so the solve of the challenge with writeups will be easier to read.

I also apologize if I didn’t mention the CTFs from which the challenges were taken. This happens because, when publishing an old challenge, I might have forgotten which competition it came from. If the creators of a challenge would like to be credited, they can contact me and I will gladly update the repository.

There are also many challenges that I unfortunately wasn’t able to publish. Some because I lost either the exploit or the challenge itself, and many others because they are part of the CyberChallenge.IT project (Especially web challenges) or pwn.college, and therefore I cannot publish their solutions.
